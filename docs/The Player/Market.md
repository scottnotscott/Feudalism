<h1> Markets around Sennwyr </h1>

### Village Market
Each village's market is accessible by the residents of that village only. 
This allows players to contribute to their villages economy and provide favourable deals for members of their village.


### Global Market
Additionally there will be a rotating travelling market which visits each village in turn offering wares collected from other villages. This serves as a global marketplace. Generally items bought from the Global Marketplace will be more expensive, but will have a greater variety of goods.

You can trade any item that does not feature the untradable tag. You can find out if an item is tradable by hovering over it on the inventory screen. If it doesn't say Soulbound or Untradeable then you can list it on the Global Marketplace for as much as you like. If the item fails to sell within 3 days, the item is lost forever.
