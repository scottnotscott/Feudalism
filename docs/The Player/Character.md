# Character

First of all, welcome to the game.

When creating a new character in Feudalism you will have to select your village. 
Villages have various different themes, economies and strength in war. Largely dependant on the residents of the village and the competency of the clans and leaders of those villages. The four villages of Sennwyr are Shroud, Konoki, Current & Syndicate. You can read more about the villages [Here](../The%20World/Sennwyr.md).

## Beginners first steps

OK. Don't panic. You've signed up, logged in and are presented with a village selection screen. WTF do you do next? Well, fear not newbie. Hover over each of the cards and get a feel for what village you identify with most. Villages are an important mechanic and can often dictate how you play the game and even who you may interact with. But we needn't worry yet, we can change it later. Once you've selected your village you will be brought to the main game dashboard where you can proceed to do... well, most anything. Gz!

Now you've got your village selected, one of the most important things to know is how can I ask for help or recieve support? Well that's quite simple. You can use the TavernChat icon to speak to the members of your village (your allies). OR you can use the HelpChat channel located next to the WorldChat channel on any page of the site. If you are stuck, or need general in-game advice generally out of character then you can use the help chat. This is a global chat for immediate support from knowledgeable players. If you're not getting help in-game, then we apologise. You can reach out to us here: help@feud.org or you can join our discord by clicking this link: [discord](https://discord.gg/VMteEDpp).

With that out the way it's time to take a look at some of the game Mechanics. 

## Skills

Skills in this game have two categories. Skills you get resources from are called Gathering skills. This includes: Woodcutting, Fishing, Mining & Foraging. Skills you may spend resources on are known as Artisan skills this includes: Crafting (leatherworks, gemworks), Smithing (metalworks), Alchemy (herbworks). 
Each skill has a skill level and experience value. Content often has level requirements before you can engage with it. Participate in activities for each skill by visiting the skill page. You will then see a list of activities you meet the level requirement for. Each skill has a maximum level of 99. Content that requires a level to unlock will typically provide greater XP rewards as well as loot. Artisan skills provide the player with a way to craft items useful in combat and skilling.

#### Gathering skills

Woodcutting allows you to cut trees for wood. There is a base rate of experience you can earn per successful action which can be modified with additional variables. These are yet to be defined. 
All of the gathering skills will work the same way for the most part. There will be various tiers of each resource the player can gather based on their level and equipment. 
Generally resources gained from gathering skills will go into either directly funding your account by selling them to traders or the exchange. Resources may also be spent on various artisan skills.
Gathering skills also on tick have a chance at rolling the gathering skills global loot table which includes lots of juicy rewards including some powerful tools to aid in gathering skills and automation items for the artisan skills!

#### Artisan skills

Artisan skills include the combination of one resource with a multitude of others to garner some useful result. Beit armours, foods or potions. By low tier items not being dropped by bosses and keeping the NPC loot pool separate we can keep a healthy price on low tier items and make it so the newer players can still contribute valuable resources to their village OR sell them to the market and make some side money. 
A lot of the best equipment in the game will require high artisan levels. Players should aim to level these high as fast as possible in order to engage in raids and dungeons earlier should they be combat inclined.

## Combat

Combat in the game is turn-based. Events are real-time and caught as they happen. You can attack or be attacked by players of the enemy factions that are the same rank as you or one above/below you. You don't lose items on death but will need to pay for your character to be healed or alternatively wait for a member of the village to heal you.

    hint: use the TavernChat to request a revive from a medic!
