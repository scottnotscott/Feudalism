This is a rough example of how player vs player turn based combat in Feudalism could play out. 
Players can call for help, battles are dynamic and can hold multiple users for each side.
Each turn is comprised of 3 actions, you can spend your actions however you see fit beit picking an ability to use,
consuming a potion and calling for aid. These are then done in order as the turn counter ends.

This is in very early development and is very likely to change.
