Each village is unique, they will have their own economies. Villages demand a group effort for common goal. Benefiting the village overall will directly benefit members of that Village. Each village will have a number of Clans/Factions (Which are combat focussed teams) which relate to war and the raiding of enemy villages. Each village will have a number of guilds (Which are resource focussed teams) which relate to village economy. They are interested in monetary gain, and affluence throughout the village. Resources people gain from either Clan or Guild activities can be donated to your specific Village resource container. Things the player will gather over time beit coin from player killings, or any of the number of ways to gain resources will all have a direct purpose. Emperors So who decides on how to spend the village resources? Who can create/disband Clans or Guilds? Who has control over allies and war? Who can tax their citizens? That's right, the Emperor. The Emperor role of a village is player controlled. It will usually be held by respected members of a village OR by the strongest player of each village. In order to become Emperor, you will have to challenge the current Emperor and have been a member of that village for at least 30 days. This stops people swapping villages to take Emperor for game throwing purposes as returning to their preferred village will result in a 60 day round trip. An Emperor who is challenged will recieve the notification. They can choose when to respond to the battle request, and can only accept the challenge if both players are not in combat, both players are awake and in the same location (your village). If an Emperor does not respond within 24hrs they automatically relinquish the status to the challenger. Emperor Responsibilities The Emperor has access to a number of Village-Shaping mechanics. They can spend resourced donated to the village on Village Raids/Bosses/Events which directly benefit the members of that village. They can also unlock buffs and other time-related benefits for their villagers. They can also create Clans up to a limit of 8 village clans. They can also create Guilds up to a limit of 8 village guilds. Clans generate currency per player kill of enemy village. They also earn a currency for engaging in boss and monster related activities. Clans also have a bounty system. More on that later. Guilds generate currency per resource gathered or artisan item crafted. Most of the gathering skill resources such as ores, fish and wood can be donated to the Village supply. New Emperors must wait 15 days into their tenure before disbanding active clans or guilds. A single Emperor can not hold the title for more than 60 days consecutively. They can however give the title to a village member and then take it back providing they cooperate to reset an Emperors tenure. War Policy The Emperor dictates the war policy. In order to shape their villages war effort, the Emperor has access to the war screen, which allows them to prioritise enemy villages and provide greater rewards for raiding specific villages instead of a split effort against all villages. Villages can be allied providing two Emperors agree to ally. If yourare a member of Shroud village, and your Emperor targets Konoki in the war efforts, if you travel to Konoki and kill one of their members you will recieve additional war efforts rewards generating increased war currency for the Emperor. Clans Each clan is created manually by an Emperor of a Village. Each Clan has a leader and staff to help manage the Clan. Clans main purpose is generating currency from killing enemy players. Clan members find themselves engaging in war more than Artisan/Gathering skills. Clans will gain bonuses for engaging in multiuser combat of members of their own guild. Encouraging team based raiding. Clans also have access to the bounty system where normal members of the village can put a bounty on an enemy villagers head for whatever reason. Clans who accept the bounty go and kill that person will be rewarded both by the player who created the bounty, and by the village as a whole. Completed bounties will have a large reward. Guilds Similarly to Clans, each Guild is created manually by an Emperor of a Village. Each Guild has a leader and staff to help manage the Guild. Guilds main purpose is generating currency from Gathering resources or Combining resources using the Artisan skills. This currency generated can then be donated to the Village supply and the spent on Village specific rewards. The guild will have purchase orders where members of a village can request a purchase order of a specific resource. The player will pay a cheaper rate for these resources and the guild member will gain currency for fulfilling the order. This is the same currency used by the Emperor. Emperor Rewards The Emperor of a village can spend the village supply resources on various benefits for the village. These benefits are temporary. Lasting at most a few hours. The kind of rewards we'll be adding will be long these lines: Village boss spawn. (A boss for the village with a shared health pool. Drops exclusive unique items) Village specific XP boost (A flat XP boost to a specific skill) Village micro combat boost (A flat Def or combat style boost of around 5%) Reduced player healing costs Village crypt spawn (A crypt 4 players enter together providing a series of combat challenges for group rewards. Multiple teams of the same village can enter.) Double resource drops from gathering skills Chance at one component used in artisan skills is not spent when creating items using an Artisan skill such as Alchemy.","title":"Game"},{"location":"Game/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"Game/#villages","text":"In the world of Senwyr there are four Villages or Cities.(We haven't decided on a name yet.)

When creating a new character in Feudalism you will have to select your village. Villages have various different themes, economies and strength in war. Largely dependant on the residents of the village and the competency of the clans and leaders of those villages. The four villages of Sennwyr are Shroud, Konoki, Current & Syndicate. You can read more about the villages here: Syndicate , Current , Shroud & Konoki . Beginners first steps OK. Don't panic. You've signed up, logged in and are presented with a village selection screen. WTF do you do next? Well, fear not newbie. Hover over each of the cards and get a feel for what village you identify with most. Villages are an important mechanic and can often dictate how you play the game and even who you may interact with. But we needn't worry yet, we can change it later. Once you've selected your village you will be brought to the main game dashboard where you can proceed to do... well, most anything. Gz! Now you've got your village selected, one of the most important things to know is how can I ask for help or recieve support? Well that's quite simple. You can use the TavernChat icon to speak to the members of your village (your allies). OR you can use the HelpChat channel located next to the WorldChat channel on any page of the site. If you are stuck, or need general in-game advice generally out of character then you can use the help chat. This is a global chat for immediate support from knowledgeable players. If you're not getting help in-game, then we apologise. You can reach out to us here: help@feud.org or you can join our discord by clicking this link: discord . With that out the way it's time to take a look at some of the game Mechanics. There's a number of ways you can play this game but for most of them you're going to need a bit of money. Getting money To get money, visit the slayer tab and select the lowest tier monster you can see. Click it to enter turn based combat. Each turn you will have a 30 second window to select your ability or weapon. If you fail to do so one will be selected for you automatically (you can set this in the settings). At first you will have no weapons, but you can still punch the basic monster to death. If you need to heal you can select the healing potion (sm) in your inventory on your turn, doing so will consume it, and spend your turn using that item on yourself. Once the monster is dead, check the loot drops you got and then select the Trader window. You can sell your goods here for a reasonable price to get some starting currency. It's from this NPC you can then purchase some tools to get you started with other skills. Buy any hatchet, pickaxe, net & rod you can afford. You will need one of each if you wish to participate in any of the gathering skills. Skills Skills in this game have two categories. Skills you get resources from are called Gathering skills. This includes: Woodcutting, Fishing, Mining & Foraging. Skills you may spend resources on are known as Artisan skills this includes: Crafting (leatherworks, gemworks), Smithing (metalworks), Alchemy (herbworks). Gathering skills Woodcutting allows you to cut trees for wood. There is a base rate of experience you can earn per successful action which can be modified with additional variables. These are yet to be defined. All of the gathering skills will work the same way for the most part. There will be various tiers of each resource the player can gather based on their level and equipment. Generally resources gained from gathering skills will go into either directly funding your account by selling them to traders or the exchange. Resources may also be spent on various artisan skills. Gathering skills also on tick have a chance at rolling the gathering skills global loot table which includes lots of juicy rewards including some powerful tools to aid in gathering skills and automation items for the artisan skills! Artisan skills Artisan skills include the combination of one resource with a multitude of others to garner some useful result. Beit armours, foods or potions. By low tier items not being dropped by bosses and keeping the NPC loot pool separate we can keep a healthy price on low tier items and make it so the newer players can still contribute valuable resources to their village OR sell them to the market and make some side money. A lot of the best equipment in the game will require high artisan levels. Players should aim to level these high as fast as possible in order to engage in raids and dungeons earlier should they be combat inclined. Combat Combat in the game is turn-based. Events are real-time and caught as they happen. You can attack or be attacked by players of the enemy factions that are the same rank as you or one above/below you. You don't lose items on death but will need to pay for your character to be healed or alternatively wait for a member of the village to heal you. hint: use the TavernChat to request a revive from a medic!","title":"Character"},{"location":"You%2C%20the%20player/Character/#character","text":"First of all, welcome to the game.
